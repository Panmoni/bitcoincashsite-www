       Hyper-inflation, central-bank money-printing and other government corruption is consistently reducing the
      purchasing power of your bank deposits, cash and other fiat-denominated assets. Why are you letting the rich and
      powerful loot the fruits of your labor? Bitcoin Cash fixes all nation-state and corporate limits on your economic
      growth and financial well-being.
