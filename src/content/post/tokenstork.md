## Innovative Tools for Growing the CashTokens Ecosystem

We stand at a pivotal moment in the evolution of the BCH CashTokens ecosystem. With [TokenStork.com](https://tokenstork.com), [Drop](https://drop.tokenstork.com), and _[Survive the Bull Run](https://survivethebullrun.com)_, we have the potential to revolutionize how tokens are created, distributed, and engaged with on the BCH blockchain.

But to bring this vision to life, I need your support.

1. A first-class token market cap website and tokenization platform (TokenStork).
2. A first-class token airdrop tool (Drop).
3. A creative and captivating game that encourages users to procure, hold and create new CashTokens (_Survive the Bull Run_).

**Let's make this vision a reality.**

Thank you for your support, trust, and belief in this project.

## Pledge Now

Pledge now at [flipstarter.tokenstork.com](https://flipstarter.tokenstork.com).

## Vision and Challenge

Our vision is clear: forge a CashTokens ecosystem that stands unrivaled, a beacon of efficiency, accessibility, scalability and innovation that not only matches but exceeds the capabilities and low fees of any other blockchain.

The challenge we face with the BCH CashTokens ecosystem is:

(a) how to make it easier to create and manage tokens,

(b) how to disseminate the opportunity to create tokens on BCH, and

(c) how to get more tokens into the hands of holders in fun, creative and useful ways.

The next wave of BCH adoption can be driven by entrepreneurs who are bringing their ideas to life using on-chain tokens. By harnessing the power of BCH and tokenization, we can transform micro-economies around the globe, making financial services accessible to all, and solving problems fiat currency and tradfi never can.

The challenge of [sustainable inflows](https://morelibertynow.com/merchant-adoption-is-pointless-without-regular-growing-inflows/) continues to be a hurdle for Bitcoin Cash adoption. What if tokenization unlocks the tools to bring millions of new businesses and users onto Bitcoin Cash?

We have an amazing opportunity to build an unparalleled token experience on Bitcoin Cash — one that can drive adoption, innovation, real-world use cases and address the [inflows challenge](https://morelibertynow.com/merchant-adoption-is-pointless-without-regular-growing-inflows/).

**But to unleash this potential, we need tools that simplify token discovery, creation, and engagement.**

Towards that end, I’ve created the opportunity to support this TokenStork.com flipstarter. And to earn some **cool perks** in the process!

![](https://static.panmoni.com/flipstarter.tokenstork.com/wayforward.png)

### What I’m Building

This TokenStork.com Flipstarter aims to catalyze the BCH CashTokens ecosystem with three interconnected projects:

#### TokenStork 1.0

- **What**: A market-cap, token data and tokenization platform for BCH CashTokens that makes it easy to find, track, research, create and manage BCH CashTokens, all in one place.
- **Why**: Enable new BCH investors to see complete, professionally-presented token data at a glance. Enable new BCH builders to seamlessly create and manage tokens.

#### Drop 0.1.0

- **What**: A flexible airdrop tool for BCH CashTokens that makes it trivial to airdrop tokens in any number of creative ways with a user-friendly interface, thus adding new users to the ecosystem.
- **Why**: Enable token creators to airdrop tokens easily and thereby increase CashTokens adoption.

#### Survive the Bull Run 0.1.0

- **What**: An addictive clicker game / token-distribution game for BCH CashTokens that entertains while educating users on the nuances of crypto investments, encouraging responsible accumulation of CashTokens and fostering a deeper connection with the BCH ecosystem.
- **Why**: Enable anyone, including the least sophisticated BCH users, to accumulate CashTokens in a fun, addictive way.

These projects provide unique tools and creative games that can attract new people to BCH CashTokens, while also serving as examples to developing builders of how to build with CashTokens and inspiration for what can be done with BCH smart contracts.

By supporting this Flipstarter, you're not just funding projects — you're nurturing the soil from which the next generation of BCH dapps can sprout.

I hope you will agree that these goals serve the continued growth of the BCH CashTokens ecosystem, and that you will **consider supporting this initiative**.

I’ll be releasing a walkthrough video for this project soon at [youtube.com/@BCHWorks](https://www.youtube.com/@BCHWorks?sub_confirmation=1). Please subscribe now.

### Updates

Join the conversation on our updates and share your thoughts on how we can together keep building the BCH ecosystem. I expect to be dropping vlogs, mockups, decks and code updates as this campaign progresses.

## About Me

![](https://static.panmoni.com/flipstarter.tokenstork.com/mesection.png)

I'm George Donnelly, a Bitcoin builder since 2011, Web3 coder, project manager, freelance marketer & writer. I’ve led multiple successful BCH projects, from UX to local onboarding, merchant adoption and beyond, since 2019. [Dozens of community members](https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/about) have funded my work.

[My portfolio](https://georgedonnelly.com/portfolio/) is a testament to my commitment, showcasing initiatives that have propelled BCH forward, touching lives and opening doors to financial inclusion across the globe.

### My Projects

Some of my past and current BCH projects include the following:

- [Token Pioneers flipstarter](https://gist.github.com/georgedonnelly/317aa1746159dc575c7f612eff475d56) (in progress)
- [Bitcoin Agents Venezuela 2021 campaign & photobook](https://static.panmoni.com/georgedonnellycom/Bitcoin-Agents-Venezuela-photo-book.pdf)
- [BitcoinCash.site Flipstarter](https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/blog/panmoni-flipstarter-final-report) (overdelivered)
- [The Road to Mass Adoption 2021 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arFDrjx_2JY)
- [Identification of the inflows challenge](https://morelibertynow.com/merchant-adoption-is-pointless-without-regular-growing-inflows/)

### My Mission

My unwavering goal is to usher in an era of universal prosperity through the mass adoption of BCH. By harnessing the power of BCH for cross-border monetary and financial solutions, we can bridge the gap for the financially excluded, catalyzing a wave of prosperity and reducing human suffering on a global scale.

The mission to onboard 1 million new users to BCH — that I first [put forth in 2020](https://archive.ph/50X6L#selection-123.70-123.125) — remains at the heart of my endeavors, a beacon guiding my efforts toward a future where BCH is a cornerstone of everyday life.

We are faced with the amazing opportunity to marry the [financially excluded billions of working people in the developing world](https://morelibertynow.com/a-manifesto-for-bitcoin-cash-adoption-in-the-developing-world/) with the amazing potential of BCH. Together, these add up to amazing prosperity and alleviation of human suffering, not to mention new mindshare, new credibility, new users, merchants and builders for BCH.

By supporting TokenStork.com, Drop, and Survive the Bull Run, you're not just backing projects — you're championing a vision of innovation, inclusion, and growth for BCH.

See the roadmap at [TokenStork.com/roadmap](https://tokenstork.com/roadmap).

### 2. Drop 0.1.0

![](https://static.panmoni.com/flipstarter.tokenstork.com/drop.png)

Drop makes it trivial to airdrop CashTokens in any number of interesting ways with a friendly UI. Built with Solid.js, LibAuth, Electrum Cash & Typescript.

The tool will be made [open-source](https://github.com/Panmoni/drop) and available under an MIT license, with its 0.0.1 release.

You can see the website, which remains under development, at [drop.tokenstork.com](https://drop.tokenstork.com/).

#### Drop Use Cases

- **Targeted Promotions:** Airdrop specific tokens directly to holders of other tokens/NFTs with similar interests or characteristics. This encourages existing community members to interact with your project and fosters cross-project collaboration.
- **Stimulating Ecosystem Activity:** Launch surprise airdrops based on BCH transaction levels or other on-chain activity. This fosters excitement, buzz, and rewards positive behavior within the CashTokens ecosystem.
- **Automated Airdrops Based on Specific Criteria**: Implementing smart contracts to automatically distribute airdrops to holders who meet specific criteria, such as holding a certain token or NFT, participating in a specific event, or being active within a certain period.
- **Fair and Equitable Token Launches**: Distributing initial token supply more equitably among a broad audience to prevent concentration of ownership and promote a more decentralized and fair token distribution.
- **Rewarding Active Users:** Airdrop tokens to the most active users on your platform/dapp or based on recent L1 transactions. Incentivizes platform engagement and rewards those who are already utilizing the BCH blockchain.
- **Crowdfunding Support:** Reward loyal backers of your project's Flipstarter campaign.
- **Distributing Utility Tokens:** Use the tool to distribute your project's own utility token to stakeholders, users, or potential early adopters. This bootstraps user engagement and a base economy for your dapp.
- **Airdrop NFTs:** Promote or distribute collections, digital art, or project-related NFTs with ease. This adds scarcity and can create collector demand, especially if NFTs are tied to unique perks or features.
- **Bulk Gifting:** Facilitate sending small gift amounts of tokens to a large number of individuals easily. This could be used for holiday bonuses, customer appreciation, or other gestures aimed at spreading BCH knowledge and adoption.
- **Loyalty Programs and Customer Rewards**: Creating loyalty programs for businesses where customers can receive airdropped tokens as rewards for purchases, encouraging repeat business and customer loyalty.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Incentives**: Airdropping governance tokens or other incentives to users of a DeFi platform based on their interaction level, liquidity provision, or other criteria, stimulating participation and investment.
- **Generating Raw Transactions for Broadcast**: Enabling advanced users or developers to generate raw airdrop transactions for manual broadcasting, offering flexibility for integrating with other services or custom workflows.

### 3. Survive the Bull Run 0.1.0

![](https://static.panmoni.com/flipstarter.tokenstork.com/stbr.png)

_Survive the Bull Run_ (STBR) is a clicker/idle game (similar to the legendary [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)) and token airdrop tool that aims to entertain and keep users engaged until they are ready to make their own on-chain tokens.

The theme of STBR is to simulate what life in crypto is like, with market crashes, scam emails, billionaire opportunities and all the rest of it. But as a game, or series of games.

STBR is a fun way to add new CashTokens to your portfolio and maintain connection with the CashTokens ecosystem.

STBR is (currently) built with Next.js & Typescript. The website will be made [open-source](https://github.com/Panmoni/survive-the-bull-run) and available under an MIT license no later than its 0.1.0 release.

Visit the website at [SurviveTheBullRun.com](https://survivethebullrun.com/) and start hoarding coins today!

#### Survive the Bull Run Use Cases

_Survive the Bull Run_ offers a unique blend of gaming, education, and BCH engagement. Here are its use cases:

1. **Entertaining Onboarding to BCH & CashTokens:** _Survive the Bull Run_’s gamified environment provides an engaging, low-pressure entry point for users new to Bitcoin Cash. By simulating the volatile world of crypto, it teaches core concepts (volatility, scams, HODLing) in a fun way.
2. **Incentivized Token Accumulation:** The core loop of earning in-game currency and converting it to real-world tokens motivates continued engagement. This acts as a low-stakes way for users to acquire their first CashTokens and potentially spark further personal investment.
3. **Marketing Tool for Token Projects:** Projects can sponsor special events, unique in-game assets, or challenges within STBR. This provides direct promotional touchpoints to a receptive audience who's already interested in BCH/crypto.
4. **Engagement and Retention in the BCH Ecosystem**: By simulating the crypto market's ups and downs, STBR keeps users engaged with the CashTokens ecosystem, promoting sustained interest and activity within the BCH space.
5. **Community Building and Social Interaction**: Through leaderboards and social sharing features, STBR encourages community interaction, competition, and socialization, fostering a sense of belonging and community among players.
6. **Educational Tool for Cryptocurrency Concepts**: STBR serves as an interactive platform to educate players about cryptocurrency market dynamics, including bull runs, market crashes, and the importance of strategic investment, in an engaging and risk-free environment.
7. **Achievement and Reward Systems**: The ability to mint achievements as NFTs and reach various in-game milestones offers tangible rewards for engagement, potentially introducing players to the concept and utility of NFTs.
8. **Promotion of Strategic Thinking and Financial Literacy**: Through asset management, boosts, challenges, and the FUD mechanic, STBR promotes strategic thinking and financial literacy, skills valuable for cryptocurrency investment and beyond.
9. **Cross-Promotion with Other Crypto Projects**: The platform can serve as a cross-promotional tool, introducing players to other BCH projects and platforms through in-game assets, partnerships, and sponsored events.

STBR leverages gamification to demystify the cryptocurrency market for newcomers while providing depth and continued engagement for experienced users, thereby supporting both BCH educational objectives and the broader goal of BCH adoption and community growth.

### 4. Stretch Goals

![](https://static.panmoni.com/flipstarter.tokenstork.com/visiony.png)

The following goals are in no particular order. I can run a poll to assign priorities to them, if the community requests it. As these are stretch goals, there are no guarantees that I will get to them for this flipstarter.

But I will certainly try, as I’m excited about them!

1. Bring back or re-create [paybutton.org](https://paybutton.org/) (MVP), a product that permits website owners to start accepting BCH just by adding a few lines of code to their website. Paybutton was previously a BCH-only product but currently only supports another coin.
2. MVP of a FOSS/MIT-licensed NFT-sales website in a box, easy to launch and install, so that anyone with an NFT collection can easily launch their sales website using CashTokens and rapidly start selling.
3. MVP of an on-chain warrant canary service that uses parsable CashTokens NFTs to permit individuals, companies and institutions to issue their warrant canaries with the immutability and security of the BCH blockchain.
4. Make a multi-hour, comprehensive CashTokens / BCH contract development video and text tutorial, upload it to various video hosting platforms and contribute it to FreeCodeCamp so that more builders can find BCH and start building dapps.

I have a couple large projects beyond these that have crystalized as a direct result of my years of ground adoption work, but I’m not sure they’re quite ready.

As usual, at the completion of this flipstarter’s deliverables, I will also issue a detailed report on what was delivered and measure that against what I promised.

If the flipstarter closes before you can get your pledge in, you can make a [direct donation](bitcoincash:qz3pxmwda8gd42wa8k9yfxcwhcaapeuhygjc8mc4m8) (see below) and still claim your perk. Additional funds will be applied to extending the flipstarter timeline and to stretch goals.

## Timeline

This flipstarter will run for up to 8 weeks. I will commence work no later than 4 weeks after the Flipstarter’s successful completion. I aim to finish the work within 13 weeks, but will take as long as is necessary to complete the promised deliverables.

## Raise

I’m looking to raise at least $12,000 USD, which was equivalent to 43.95 BCH at the time of launch.

Additional funds via direct donation or improvements in the BCH exchange rate will be used to extend the timeline and accomplish stretch goals.
